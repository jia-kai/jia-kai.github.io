Hello! I aim for creating more reliable artificial intelligence with
perspectives from programming languages, symbolic logic, and logical reasoning.
I have approached this goal via neural network verification. Currently, I am
trying to invent new frameworks for intelligent systems that could reliably
learn and infer.

I am currently a third-year computer science PhD student at MIT, advised by
[Martin Rinard](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/){:target="_blank"}.

I obtained my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University
in 2015. Before starting my PhD career at MIT, I worked at a startup company
where I led the development of an in-house deep learning system that was later
open sourced as [MegEngine
](https://github.com/MegEngine/MegEngine){:target="_blank"}.
