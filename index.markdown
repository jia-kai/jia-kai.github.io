Hello! I aim to create more reliable artificial intelligence systems, drawing on
perspectives from programming languages and symbolic reasoning. My research
interests span across computer science, from computer systems (architecture,
high-performance computing, and software engineering) to the computational
modeling of complex phenomena in areas such as computer graphics and algorithmic
game theory. I thrive on developing mathematical and computational tools to
solve challenging problems and have a particular passion for designing and
coding large-scale, agile software systems tailored for intricate tasks.

I currently work at [Ecopia AI](https://www.ecopiatech.com/){:target="_blank"}.
I earned my PhD in computer science at MIT under the mentorship of Professor
[Martin Rinard](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/){:target="_blank"} and I
hold a B.E. in computer science from Tsinghua University. Before my PhD journey,
I worked at a startup company where I led the development of an in-house deep
learning system, which was later open sourced as
[MegEngine](https://github.com/MegEngine/MegEngine){:target="_blank"}.
