Hello! I aim to create more reliable artificial intelligence with programming
languages, symbolic logic, and logical reasoning perspectives. I have approached
this goal via neural network verification. Currently, I am trying to invent new
frameworks for intelligent systems that could reliably learn and infer. I am
also interested in computer systems and high-performance computing.  I enjoy
building large, working software systems with elegant complexity.

I am a third-year computer science PhD student at MIT, advised by [Martin
Rinard](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/).

I obtained my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University
in 2015. Before starting my PhD career at MIT, I worked at a startup company
where I led the development of an in-house deep learning system that was later
open sourced as [MegEngine](https://github.com/MegEngine/MegEngine).
