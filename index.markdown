Hello! I aim to create more reliable artificial intelligence systems with
perspectives from programming languages, symbolic logic, and logical reasoning.
I am also interested in computer systems (architecture, high-performance
computing, software engineering) and computational modeling of the world
(computer graphics, computational game theory). I enjoy developing mathematical
and computational tools to solve problems. I also enjoy programming, especially
building large, agile software systems for complex tasks.

I am currently a computer science PhD student at MIT, advised by [Martin
Rinard](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/). I obtained my B.E. in Computer
Science and Technology at Tsinghua University in 2015. Before starting my PhD
career at MIT, I worked at a startup company where I led the development of an
in-house deep learning system that was later open sourced as
[MegEngine](https://github.com/MegEngine/MegEngine).
